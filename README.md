# n8n-workflows

Welcome to my collection of n8n workflows! This repository serves as a central place to store and manage the various automation workflows I've built and learned using n8n.

n8n is a powerful workflow automation tool that allows you to connect applications and services with a visual editor, code, or both. This repository is a reflection of my journey in exploring and implementing automation solutions with n8n.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to keep different workflows logically separated. Each subdirectory typically contains the files related to a specific n8n workflow or a set of related workflows.

- `/Expense Tracking Automation`: Contains the workflow(s) and related files for automating expense tracking.
- ... (Other directories for future workflows)

The workflows are usually stored as `.json` files, which can be easily imported into your own n8n instance.

## Getting Started

To use any of the workflows in this repository, you will need a running instance of n8n. If you don't have one, you can follow the official n8n documentation to set it up: [https://docs.n8n.io/](https://docs.n8n.io/)

Once you have n8n running, you can import a workflow by:

1. Navigating to the directory of the desired workflow in this repository.
2. Opening the `.json` file to view its content.
3. Copying the entire JSON content.
4. In your n8n instance, click the "New" button in the top right corner.
5. Choose "Import from JSON".
6. Paste the copied JSON content and click "Import".

**Please Note:** Workflows may require specific credentials or configurations (e.g., API keys, database connections) to function correctly. You will need to set these up within your n8n instance after importing the workflow. Refer to the README within each workflow's directory for specific instructions and dependencies.

## Contributing

Currently, this repository is primarily for my personal learning and storage. However, I am open to suggestions and potential collaborations. If you have ideas for improving existing workflows or have new workflows you'd like to share that align with the purpose of this repository, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Please ensure any contributed workflows are well-documented and follow best practices for n8n development.
